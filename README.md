# Module5_Challenge

The written analysis for this challenge can be found at the top of the pymaceuticals_starter file. 

The code used in this challenge assignment was created by me. It was influenced by work with classmates, tutors both in and outside of the Data Analytics program, as well as looking up examples of code on pandas documentation and google.
